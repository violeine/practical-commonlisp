https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/10/25/lispings-ala-john-mccarthy/)
- interactive shell to write&experiment lisp code
- 4 step
  - read input
  - evaluate input
  - print the result from eval step
  - loop back to read
- dont need to restart the repl to try out new stuf, no need to compile and
wait
  - typical lisp program doesnt need restart repl at all in the entire dev
  cycle
- good for remote debugging(just tap to the repl ip:port then modify the code)
  - NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission debugging $100M hardware that is 100
  milion miles away
