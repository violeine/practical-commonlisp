- have fun? lots of people claim it
- get things done faster with code by clearly express your intention (more than
other lang?)
- beating the avg? (http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)
- the lisp curse is  pretty cool imo (http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html)
- lisp family is way different than algol family languages (c, java, c#)
- lisp is excelent for exploratory programming?(want to write something that
even you dont know how it works)
- repl create better feedback loop than compile, type check

me: mostly for fun, "get it", and maybe learn to make some gaems with lisp
